<b> The Market Advisor for Gains using Machine Algorithms (<i>MAGMA</i>)</b>

MAGMA is your personal consultant for stock trades. It should be consulted before the market opens for the day. It suggests moves to make when the market opens, and gives its reasoning behind its choices.
MAGMA is designed to run locally, and is carefully engineered using a robust system prompt, precise stock data, current company news, and complex algorithms.
It specializes in the tech sector, and prioritizes selected companies within that area to maximize its expertise.

MAGMA specializes in three specific conversation directions, although it may be asked questions about a variety of market ideas. The user is encouraged to ask questions about specific stocks, about the health of their portfolio, and about what to do with a specific amount of disposable money (that is, the user is encouraged to ask MAGMA for a stock buy recommendation). 

With MAGMA's carefully calculated formulas and ability to get relevant data for a large number of stocks at a time, it has the capacity to weigh the risk and potential of a stocks of interest. With this information, MAGMA can recommend stocks that fit in well with the user's portfolio. MAGMA will give options for stock buys as well as reasoning for its suggestions, giving the user necessary background information and the ability to choose what makes most sense for them.

MAGMA only provides <i>suggestions</i> for market orders. Any final decisions are up to the user, and they are responsible for any trade outcomes
if they choose to heed given advice.
